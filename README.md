The idea of this project is to implement multiple statistical methods from scratch (using only the math library). This guarantees a better understanding of them while learning from the difficulties that arise in programming.

Naturally, this project does not aim to replace any existing and efficient statistical libraries but to challenge myself and learn through the process.

Any comments and feedback are welcome.

Thank you in advance,

David
